Customers
================

We record changes in:

- Collection point
- Order changes
- Status Changes
- Payment Status Changes

These are all visible to the customer in their order and billing history pages.

Tracking other events.
***********************

Other events aren't exposed to the customer. Right now, these live in an admin view, but it's conceivable this might end as a unified stream of events one day.

Reminders and Notes
--------------------

Customers have reminders set, and notes, which don't necessarily have actions associated with them.

After a reminder is marked a done, it's hidden from view, and a note is created on the customer's profile, with the same information.
